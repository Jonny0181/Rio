Just another discord theme I have been working on. For now this theme is only supporting powercord.

Help:
    The first thing you will need to know is all of your custom colors and everything will be in the Utils folder in the vars file.
    You will need to change the rgb/rgba code to something you like. ( $accent: YourNewColor )
    If you need help with anything, please do not hesitate to join the Discord server. ( https://discord.gg/8UJd8uA )
    If you see any issue with the theme please join said server above and post an issue in the #bug-report channel.
    Thank you using my theme and enjoy!
